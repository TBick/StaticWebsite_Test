-Created initial gh-pages branch and added index
-Made a Test Directory to learn how file storage and redirectories work. Pretty simple
-Added jQuery Library to main index page
-Added jQuery Element Manipulator feature with link in main page navbar.
-Layout to jEM is almost done. No javascript functionality yet.
-Added directs that navigate through the all the gh pages.
-Styled up the jEM feature a bit to look a bit better.
-Styled the main page navbar to stand out a bit more.
NOTE: Not focusing on how pretty these features look right now. They are for test purposes only.
